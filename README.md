# .inputrc.d

My readline configuration. Maintained in a directory that is intended to be
cloned into `~/.inputrc.d`, and used in conjunction with [my fish
configuration](https://github.com/davep/fish), which [ensures that `INPUTRC`
is set correctly so that this file gets
used](https://github.com/davep/fish/blob/master/conf.d/readline.fish).
